## Project Workflow

### Phase 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis

#### 01_Sales_EDA.ipynb

Complete EDA on the Sales dataset:

- Dataset overview — shape, data types, statistical summary
- Missing value assessment and duplicate detection
- Feature engineering — `Revenue` (Net), `day_of_week`, `month_name`, `date_only`
- Univariate analysis — quantity, selling price, discount, and revenue distributions
- Bivariate analysis — city vs revenue, city vs quantity, discount vs revenue, quantity vs revenue
- Daily order trend analysis

**Six business questions answered through analysis and visualization:**

| # | Business Question |
|---|---|
| Q1 | Which days generated the highest revenue? |
| Q2 | Which city generates the most revenue, orders, quantity sold, and AOV? |
| Q3 | What does customer purchasing behavior look like? (RFM Analysis) |
| Q4 | Does discount influence purchase quantity? |
| Q5 | What is the basket size distribution? (Single-item vs multi-item orders) |
| Q6 | Which days of the week see the highest order activity? |

#### 02_Product_EDA.ipynb

Complete EDA on the Products catalog:

- Dataset overview and feature understanding including L0 → L1 → L2 category hierarchy
- Missing value assessment — `brand_name` (4.46%), `manufacturer_name` (7.5%)
- Univariate analysis — L0 category distribution, top brands, manufacturers, product types, L1 categories
- Bivariate analysis — brand diversity per category, manufacturer diversity per category

**Four business questions answered:**

| # | Business Question |
|---|---|
| Q1 | Which L0 categories have the highest product variety? |
| Q2 | Which brands have the widest category presence? |
| Q3 | Which manufacturers dominate the catalog? |
| Q4 | Which L1 categories have the highest product concentration? |

---

### Phase 2 — SQL Analysis

#### SQL_Exploration.sql

- Initial exploration of `sales` and `products$` tables
- Removed duplicate unnamed index columns from both tables
- Date range validation — confirmed April 1 to July 10, 2022
- Business overview KPI computation
- Created `sales_products` view — INNER JOIN of sales and products on `product_id`
- Category, brand, manufacturer, discount intensity, and gross margin analysis

#### Dashboard_Queries.sql

Structured queries for two dashboards:

**Dashboard 1 — Sales Performance**

| Query | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Business Overview KPIs | Total Orders, Customers, Gross Revenue, Net Revenue, AOV, Discount Rate |
| City-wise Performance | Orders, Units Sold, Revenue, AOV per city |
| Daily Revenue Trend | Orders and revenue grouped by date |
| Revenue Trend by City | Daily revenue split by city for multi-line trend chart |

**Dashboard 2 — Product Performance**

| Query | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Product Catalog KPIs | Unique Products, Categories, Manufacturers, Brands |
| Revenue by L0 Category | Category-level orders, units, and net revenue |
| Top 15 Brands | Brand-level orders, units sold, revenue |
| Top 10 Manufacturers | Manufacturer-level orders, units sold, revenue |
| Top 15 Products | Product-level orders, units sold, revenue |
| Discount Intensity | Discount percentage by category |
| Profit & Gross Margin | Estimated profit and margin % per category |

## Key Findings

### Sales

- **Delhi** is the strongest market with **₹227.25 Cr. revenue and 4.74M orders** — nearly double HR-NCR, the second-ranked city.
- **HR-NCR (₹113.42 Cr.)** outperformed Bengaluru (₹86.02 Cr.) despite being a smaller region — driven by higher average transaction values.
- **Friday** consistently drives the highest revenue and order volume across all cities — a clear end-of-week demand pattern.
- **Discount Rate is just 0.62%** of gross revenue — discounts play a minimal role, confirming customers buy largely at full price.
- **RFM segmentation** revealed a significant share of customers fall in Hibernating or Lost segments — indicating churn risk and a need for targeted retention.
- **Basket size is predominantly single-item** across all cities — a significant cross-sell and upsell opportunity exists platform-wide.
- Revenue spikes on specific days align with promotional events or monthly salary cycles.

### Products

- **Home & Office** is the largest category with 4,734 products — deepest catalog and highest brand variety.
- **HOT** is the dominant manufacturer with 2,621 products — significant supply concentration risk.
- **Urban Platter** has the widest category presence, operating across 11 L0 categories — strongest cross-category brand.
- **Combo** is the most common product type — indicating a platform-wide bundling and value-pack strategy.
- **Kitchen & Dining Needs** is the largest L1 sub-category by product count.
- **Specials, Paan Corner, and Chicken/Meat/Fish** have thin catalogs — clear catalog expansion opportunities.

## Business Recommendations

### Sales

- **Double down on Delhi and HR-NCR** — the two strongest markets deserve prioritized marketing investment and inventory planning.
- **Grow Mumbai and Bengaluru** — both cities show headroom in orders and AOV with targeted acquisition campaigns.
- **Re-evaluate discount strategy** — discounts are not meaningfully driving purchase volume; redirect budget toward loyalty programs for high-value RFM segments.
- **Run Friday and weekend promotions** — the highest traffic period across all cities; flash sales and push notifications will maximize conversion.
- **Retain at-risk customers** — RFM analysis identified significant Hibernating and Lost segments; targeted win-back campaigns can recover lost revenue.
- **Improve cross-sell and bundling** — with most baskets containing a single item, stronger product recommendation logic can meaningfully lift AOV.

### Products

- **Expand Home & Office and Personal Care** — already the largest categories with strong demand; deeper catalog investment is justified.
- **Build up thin categories** — Specials, Paan Corner, and Chicken/Meat/Fish need more SKUs to improve assortment coverage and category revenue.
- **Prioritize multi-category brand partnerships** — Urban Platter, Dabur, and GHD span many categories; strengthening these relationships enables broader cross-category promotions.
- **Diversify the manufacturer base** — HOT accounts for a disproportionate share of the catalog; expanding the supplier base reduces supply chain dependency risk.
- **Improve category navigation** — high-density L1 categories need stronger filtering, search, and recommendations to prevent product discovery drop-off.
